# Deploy a war to jelastic.

This sbt plugin deploys a war generated by the xsbt-web-plugin, as such it depends on the xsbt-web-plugin.
The plugin will add the xsbt-web-plugin to your build too but won't configure it.
For more information on how to configure the xsbt-web-plugin, visit its [wiki](https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin/wiki/)

## Installing the plugin

This plugin only works with sbt 0.12.x or higher

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.casualjim" % "sbt-jelastic-deploy" % "0.1.0"
```

## Configuring the plugin

The plugin requires a couple of keys to be set. In build.sbt:

```scala
seq(jelasticSettings:_*)

email in deploy := "YOUR_EMAIL_HERE"

password in deploy := "YOUR PASSWORD HERE"

apiHoster := "app.j.layershift.co.uk"

environment in deploy := "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_HERE"
```

Optionally you can configure some other properties too, these are shown below with their default values:

```scala
comment in deploy := ""

comment in upload := ""

context in deploy := "ROOT"

onlyUpload in deploy := false

port in deploy := 443

port in upload := 443
```

## Using the plugin

The plugin adds 2 tasks: `deploy` and `upload`

The `upload` task will build a war and then upload it to the jelastic api host.
The `deploy` task will build a war, then upload and deploy it to the specified environment and context.
